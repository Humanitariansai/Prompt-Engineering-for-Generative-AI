# **Course Overview**

**Humanitarians AI — Prompt Engineering for Generative AI** is a community-driven, open-access educational project where volunteers—often recent graduates, students, and early-career technologists—**learn by teaching**.

This course is a **work in progress**, developed collaboratively through:

* Iterative outlines
* Volunteer-created lecture scripts and demos
* GitHub-hosted labs and notebooks
* Support from the **Humanitarians Courses GPT**
  [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6920a81baeb8819185cc8100ce963e95-humanitarians-courses](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6920a81baeb8819185cc8100ce963e95-humanitarians-courses)

The course focuses on **practical, ethical, and accessible prompt engineering**, aligned with Humanitarians AI’s mission to expand AI literacy and empower communities across education, healthcare, nonprofits, and the arts.

# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

Each Humanitarians AI course follows the **Learn → Build → Teach** model:

1. **Start with an Outline** (this document)
2. **Build labs and notebooks first**
3. **Use Humanitarians Courses GPT for slides & scripts**
4. **Record YouTube mini-lectures and demos**
5. **Continuously update, refine, and expand**
